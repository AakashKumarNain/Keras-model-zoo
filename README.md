# Keras Model Zoo

This repository contains pre-trained models that are readily available to use in `ff.keras` or `Keras`. 
There are two things that we are focusing on right now: `Computer Vision` and `NLP`, each of which is a `sub-package`.


# Requirements
* The models should be compatible with both `tf.keras` as well as `Keras`.
* Models should be descibed as lego blocks that are usable and which can be easliy modified as per the needs.
* Models focusing on computer vision should go under `KerasCV` and others, focusing on NLP, should go under `KerasNLP`.
